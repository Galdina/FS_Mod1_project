# Pay the Witcher in minted coin!

  In the first analysis project I will take a look at the dataset provided, try to identify the most interesting values among it and build a plots according to them so we can visualize the information easily and come up with some conclusions.

_Note: Do you know what are similar between data scientist and witcher? - They change eyes color during the work._

## Part 1. Work with dataset.
I'm only at the beginning of the journey into a fascinating world of Data Science. The dataset is the first location on the way.
  
  I have some movie-related data from:
* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org
  
All website from a list contain serves as an online databases of world cinema. This websites contains a large number of public data on films such as the title of the film, the year of release of the film, the genre of the film, the audience, the rating of critics, the duration of the film, the summary of the film, actors, directors and much more.
  
Faced with the large amount of data available on this dataset, I realize that I can't clearly connected this information from different sources. [Here]() I read all information from the files and add decryption to the fields using APIs. For my work I used sqlite3, pandas and glob libraries. After I convert dataset to convenient storage, I can continue to work with.
  
Go to the next step for I have been thinking of several solutions to fix this dataset problem with missing values as follows:
1. Delete the line with the missing values
2. Fill empty fields with specific values
3. Fill empty fields with calculations (if it posible)

## Part 2.
## Part 3.
## For Future.

All that remains in Module 1 is to put our newfound data science skills to use with a final project!
